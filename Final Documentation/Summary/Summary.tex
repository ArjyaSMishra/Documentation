Finding the limitations of the tool, benchmarx.
\subsection{Future Work}\label{subsec:futurework}
In this thesis, I have designed an application framework for the bx tool demonstrator, implemented the demonstrator based on a concrete example, and further evaluated the demonstrator to check its effectiveness in order to spread the bx concepts to a wide spread audience to the best of my knowledge and belief. However, I could not realize a few other features due to time constraints. In the following paragraphs, I discuss some enhancements that I would like to apply to my work in the future. 
\paragraph{New Rulesets}
\paragraph{New Examples} I have implemented one example in the demonstrator. However, it would be fascinating to see the implementation of a few more examples on the same or different UI platform but on the top of the same application framework.
\paragraph{Another BX tool}
\paragraph{BX Tool as a webservice}
\paragraph{New experiment}
