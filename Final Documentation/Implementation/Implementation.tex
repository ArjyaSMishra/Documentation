I am using Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern for my application framework. 
On the top, \texttt{View} (Web Browser) component is present which contains a graphical user interface and functionalities that belong to the user. With the changes on \texttt{View} component, data are being provided through interface \texttt{IDoAnalysis} to the \texttt{Controller} component and after the calculations are done, the results are sent back to the \texttt{View} through interface \texttt{IProvideResults}. Both \texttt{View} and \texttt{Controller} resides on the same machine. \texttt{Model} (Bx Tool) component encapsulates and manages the state of all models by communication with the \texttt{Controller} through interface \texttt{IRules}.

\subsection{Challenges}\label{subsec:implchallenges}
\paragraph{Bx Tool}
selecting the type of delta (refer def.)
implementing atomic deltas to track successful/failed changes translation. 

\paragraph{UI Implementation}
Designing the user interactions with high-level view was relatively easy as user have to deal with the objects with actions such as, mouse movements and button clicks. But, the real challenge was to handle the user interactions in low-level view's block structure. In low-level view, only addition and removal of objects are allowed and objects will be shown by unique colors.
