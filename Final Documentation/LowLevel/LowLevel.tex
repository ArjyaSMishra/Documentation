I am using Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern for my application framework. 
On the top, \texttt{View} (Web Browser) component is present which contains a graphical user interface and functionalities that belong to the user. With the changes on \texttt{View} component, data are being provided through interface \texttt{IDoAnalysis} to the \texttt{Controller} component and after the calculations are done, the results are sent back to the \texttt{View} through interface \texttt{IProvideResults}. Both \texttt{View} and \texttt{Controller} resides on the same machine. \texttt{Model} (Bx Tool) component encapsulates and manages the state of all models by communication with the \texttt{Controller} through interface \texttt{IRules}.
